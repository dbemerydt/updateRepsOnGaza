As of August 15 2024, Israel has murdered over 40,000 Palestinians since October 7, 2023. This a hard lower bound, as it only includes confirmed deaths, and statistically rigorous estimates of the actual number killed reach almost 200,000. Half of the dead are children, murdered with American weapons and the financial support of the USA. It should not be controversial to say that our country should not enable the murder of 100,000 children. Please support ongoing efforts to impliment an arms embargo in order to force an immediate ceasefire, and end the occupation and apartheid state of Gaza and The West Bank. 

Here are today's news on the ongoing US-funded genocide of the Palestinian people.
